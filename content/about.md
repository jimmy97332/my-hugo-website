After graduating from [**National Taiwan University**](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), I joined [**PwC**](https://www.pwc.tw/en.html) as an auditor, taking responsibility for auditing, financial analysis, internal control review, tax and management consulting, etc., for international clients in the semiconductor and financial industries. Besides cultivating my analytical ability and industrial knowledge, working at PwC exposed me to the recent development of AI and robotics automation, inspiring me to enhance productivity and efficiency with emerging technologies.

My interest in research, analysis, and the AI industry led my transition to [**Yuanta Financial Holdings**](https://www.yuanta.com/EN/). In the risk management department, I focused on optimizing evaluation models for financial products involving stocks, fixed income, and derivatives markets. Working closely with the quantitative engineering team, I developed models in Python to analyze position risks and performances of financial assets totaling over USD$10 million. Meanwhile, I kept developing my knowledge foundation of data science through credit courses on linear algebra and data structures. Equipped with a stronger quantitative background, I was able to effectively evaluate hedge risks and provide market outlook recommendations. The sense of achievement encouraged me to explore career opportunities with further study of programming and software development.  

Accordingly, I completed [**TibaMe**](https://www.tibame.com/)’s 6-month training program of *Java Cloud Service Development* with tuition sponsored by the government. By so doing, I familiarized myself with essential Java tools and frameworks and honed my skills in building scalable, efficient cloud services and applications. 

I then joined [**Ally Logistic Property (ALP)**](https://www.alp.global/en) as a backend software engineer to develop smart warehousing services. With my team, we maintain our warehouse operating system developed in Java and built on AWS microservices architecture. Our system includes a visual information system that is seamlessly connected to our clients’ warehouse management systems for data interoperability. Specifically, I modify existing applications by unit testing, regression testing, and performance testing to enhance their performance, focusing on achieving low latency and high availability. I also integrated internal software with the APIs of automatic equipment in the warehouse to streamline a comprehensive logistics ecosystem.
